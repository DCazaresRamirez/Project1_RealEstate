# Project Title

## Overview
"How do transaction data and neighborhood attributes correlate with homelessness trends over time?"
By conducting thorough analyses of transaction data and neighborhood attributes, you can gain valuable insights into the housing market dynamics and their potential impact on homelessness. These insights can help inform strategies for addressing homelessness and improving housing stability in affected communities.

## Data Sources
- https://api.developer.attomdata.com/
- https://www.huduser.gov/portal/sites/default/files/xls/2007-2023-HIC-Counts-by-State.xlsx
- **Transaction Data:** Deed and mortgage transaction data, including information on property sales, sale prices, mortgage amounts, and foreclosure activity.
- **Neighborhood Attributes:** Neighborhood data such as crime rates, school quality, proximity to amenities, and transportation access.

## Team Members and Tasks
### Team Member 1 - Victoria
#### Tasks:
- **Data Collection:** Utilize the ATTOM API to gather transaction and neighborhood attribute data.

- **Transaction Data Analysis:** Analyze trends in property ownership and sales activity over time.
- Access deed and mortgage transaction data from the ATTOM API, including information on property sales, sale prices, mortgage amounts, and foreclosure activity.
Analyze trends in property ownership and sales activity over time (2007-2023) across different states and metropolitan areas.
Identify areas with high foreclosure rates or significant changes in property sales and prices.

- **Neighborhood Attributes Analysis:** Evaluate the livability and desirability of different neighborhoods.
Access neighborhood attribute data from the ATTOM API, including crime rates, school quality, proximity to amenities, and transportation access.
Evaluate the livability and desirability of different neighborhoods based on these attributes.
Analyze how neighborhood characteristics correlate with homelessness rates across different regions and demographic groups.

- **Visualizations:** Create bar charts, line plots, and maps to visualize the data.

### Team Member 2 - Syed
#### Tasks:
- **Data Collection:** Gather homelessness count data across all 50 states from 2007 to 2023.
- **Analysis:** Analyze trends in homelessness counts over time.
- **Visualizations:** Create line plots or bar charts to visualize homelessness trends.

### Team Member 3 - Derick
#### Tasks:
- **Data Collection:** Collect demographic characteristics of homeless individuals in each state from 2007 to 2023.
- **Analysis:** Explore variations in demographic profiles of the homeless population.
- **Visualizations:** Create bar charts or pie charts to visualize demographic distributions.

### Team Member 4 - Elisabeth
#### Tasks:
- **Data Collection:** Gather data on the distribution of homelessness counts by housing type and sheltered status in each state from 2007 to 2023.
- **Analysis:** Analyze variations in the proportion of sheltered and unsheltered homeless individuals.
- **Visualizations:** Create stacked bar charts or pie charts to visualize the distribution of homeless individuals by housing type.



## Data Integration
Combine the transaction data and neighborhood attributes analysis conducted by Team Member 1 with the homelessness count data, demographic characteristics, and housing type/sheltered status data collected by Team Members 2, 3, and 4. Ensure that the datasets are properly aligned by state and year.

## Correlation Analysis
Use statistical methods such as correlation coefficients (e.g., Pearson correlation) to quantify the relationships between various factors. For example:
- Analyze the correlation between property sales activity and homelessness counts to understand how changes in property ownership may impact homelessness rates.
- Explore correlations between neighborhood attributes (e.g., crime rates, school quality) and homelessness trends to assess the influence of neighborhood characteristics on homelessness.
- Investigate the relationship between demographic profiles of the homeless population and housing market dynamics to identify any demographic factors associated with higher homelessness rates in certain areas.
- Examine correlations between housing type/sheltered status and homelessness trends to understand how different housing situations may affect homelessness rates over time.

## Visualizations
Create visualizations such as scatter plots, heatmaps, and choropleth maps to illustrate the correlations identified in the analysis. These visualizations can help communicate the relationships between various factors and provide insights into the drivers of homelessness trends.

## Interpretation and Insights
Interpret the findings from the correlation analysis and visualizations to derive insights into the underlying factors contributing to homelessness trends. Consider the implications for policy-making, urban planning, and social interventions aimed at addressing homelessness and improving housing stability.


## Conclusion
Summarize the key findings and potential next steps.
